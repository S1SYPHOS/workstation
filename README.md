# Fedora Workstation - the @S1SYPHOS way

This repository houses the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) playbook for setting up Fedora on my [personal workstation](https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/dotfiles).

It's a work in progress, with many plays left to chase ..

## Credits
I borrowed the `scripts` directory from [Grant Cohoe](https://github.com/cohoe/workstation), making the setup process way more reliable.
